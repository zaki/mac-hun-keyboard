# About

Copy the keylayout file into Library/Keyboard Layouts and you can then
select the new layout from System Preferences > Language & Text > Input Sources

# Layout

This layout puts the most important (for programming) characters back to
where they usually are on a PC keyboard (Windows, Linux, probably every
single OS got it right, except Mac OSX for some reason).

0 is now right left to 1 (rather than í, which moved to Alt+J)
Alt is now the primary way to enter symbols eg:
Alt-Q is now \ Alt-V is @ and so on.
Alt-F and Alt-G are [ and ] respectively.

In general, everything should be where it belongs on a PC keyboard.

I had pretty good luck with this on a wireless keyboard with US keys, but YMMV.
If you are stuck with a JP keyboard, either learn a new layout, or you can
still use Ctrl-Alt-0 to enter a 0, because the keyboard misses a key on the
left of 1.

Use it for whatever purpose, just don't blame me if something doesn't work out.
