## HungarianWin

This layout puts the most important (for programming) characters back to
where they usually are on a PC keyboard (Windows, Linux, probably every
single OS got it right, except Mac OSX for some reason).

- 0 is now right left to 1 (rather than í, which moved to Alt+J)
- On international QUERTY layouts you can type í with the key located between
  the left shift and the Z. You can also use that key along with the Z key
  combined with Alt to type the "<" and ">" symbols like on hungarian keyboards.
- Alt is now the primary way to enter symbols eg:
  - Alt-Q is now \ Alt-V is @ and so on.
  - Alt-F and Alt-G are [ and ] respectively.

In general, everything should be where it belongs on a PC keyboard.

I had pretty good luck with this on a wireless keyboard with US keys, but YMMV.
If you are stuck with a JP keyboard, either learn a new layout, or you can
still use Ctrl-Alt-0 to enter a 0, because the keyboard misses a key on the
left of 1.

## HungarianWinV2

This is basically the same as `HungarianWin` but `0` and `í` characters are switched,
in order to fix issues with Hungarian PC keyboards.
